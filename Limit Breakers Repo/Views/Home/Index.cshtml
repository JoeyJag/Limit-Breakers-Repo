            <h1>How it all Started</h1>
            <p>
                Riot Games was launched in 2006 with the idea to develop, publish, and support games made by the players and for the players.
                In 2009 Riot Games launched their debut game, which was "League of Legends", this was a huge commercial success, so much that
                it became an Esport and is now the most played PC game in the world.

            <h1>Online Store</h1>
            <p>
                The Riot Games online store was necessary, because we feel that since we focus on games and are always looking for new ideas and
                new ground for games, we noticed that many developers who create games, have created really amazing and brilliant games that never
                see the light of day, hence with this innovation we will allow those developers to get exposure and recognition for their amazing work.
