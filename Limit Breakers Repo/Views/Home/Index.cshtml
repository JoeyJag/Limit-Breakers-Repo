        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        Riot Games was launched in 2006 with the idea to develop, publish, and support games made by players and for players.
        In 2009 Riot Games launched their debut game which was "League of Legends", this was a huge commercial success, so much that
        it became an Esport and is now the most played PC game in the world.

        <h3>Why the Online Market?</h3>
        The Riot Games online store was necessary, because we feel that since we focus on games and are always looking for new and bright ideas
         for games, we noticed that many developers who create games, can create really amazing and brilliant games that never
        see the light of day, hence with this innovative website we will allow those developers to get exposure and recognition for their great work.
