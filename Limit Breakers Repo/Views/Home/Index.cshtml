        <h3>Why the Online Market?</h3>
     <b>   The Riot Games online store was necessary because we feel that since we focus on games and are always looking for new ideas and
        new feet for games, we noticed that many developers who create games have create really amazing and brilliant games that never
        see the daylight, hence with this iniative we will allow those developers to get exposure and recongnition for their work.
